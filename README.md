Hiya!!
 
This is a basic project that uses 2 HTTP request methods: GET and POST.

The GET method gets a list of blog posts from an API. Only the *title* and the *body* properties of the first 10 posts are displayed on the page.

With the form is possible to send a new blog post to the server and the POST method will add it to the top of the list of posts.
